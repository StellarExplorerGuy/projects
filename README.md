👋 Hey!

My free projects:

- <img src="assets/projects/faster_pr/pr.png" alt="faster_pr_icon" width="20" height="20" /> `Faster PR`: speed up the process of creating pull requests from issues that can be found on `Github [github.com, github.any-name.com]`, `GitLab [gitlab.com]`, `Trello [trello.com]`, `Jira [jsw.any-name.com]` with a plugin that automatically generates branch names, commits, and PR descriptions in just one or two clicks. Additionally, this plugin can be customized to use your own templates. The plugin is shown in issue and pull request pages.</br>Published: [<img src="assets/projects/faster_pr/chrome_icon.svg" alt="chrome_icon" width="20" height="20" />](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/faster-pr/lcenjlelbnlooigocboklccingbhiajh/), [<img src="assets/projects/faster_pr/firefox_icon.svg" alt="firefox_icon" width="20" height="20" />](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/faster-pr/).<details>
